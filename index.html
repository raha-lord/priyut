		          <h3>Fundraising <strong>«Dogs and tails»</strong></h3>
		          <p>
					The majority of Russian population reserves a special place in their heart for animals.
					Оur project is created in order to draw public attention to the problem of financing Moscow shelters .Every year there are more and more abandoned animals , and the resources of kennel are not able to take care of all of them.
					Unfortunately COVID further inflamed the situation.
					But out of crisis came opportunity and creativity—a wave of new ways to attract valuable donations.
		            <br>
		            That’s why we came up with an idea about how to help animals in our new fickle world largely in the virtuality that offered new ways for shelters and rescues to connect with supporters.
		            <br>
		            For this purpose,we created a new a fundraising platform for animal charities.
					Our website provides information about three shelters for dogs who are in desperate need of our help.

			        <h4>Prepare for your new puppy</h4>
					• Decide where your new puppy is going to sleep and have a suitable bed ready with a blanket or an old jumper.<br>
					• Ensure you have all the necessary equipment such as a feeding bowl, a water bowl, newspaper, a couple of safe toys, suitable grooming equipment for the coat type, a lead, collar and name tag, and a supply of food he is used to.<br>
					<br><img class="img-fluid" src="img/dog_and_human.png"><br><br>
					• Ensure the home environment is safe. Remove anything that you would not wish to be chewed, particularly electrical flexes and also ensure that garden fencing and gates are secure.<br>
					<h4>The puppy’s first days</h4>
					• When you collect the puppy, it is best for two people to make the journey so that someone can hold the puppy in the car. It may be a good idea to take some newspaper in case he is travel sick.<br>
		        </div>
		        <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
					• If you have bought a puppy from a breeder, make sure that you get all the relevant paperwork - such as the Kennel Club registration forms, pedigree certificate, dietary advice sheet, worming and vaccination details - at the time of collection.<br>
		        	<h4>Training your puppy</h4>
					• Get a book which can assist you with basic training techniques.<br>
					• Be gentle and kind and allow puppy time to settle in his new surroundings. Introduce him to the areas of the house where he is allowed to go and show him where his bed and bowls are located.<br>
					• Make enquiries with your local Dog Trust Dog School to learn training skills.<br>
					• Play is essential and can be used to reward good behaviour. It will also give you the opportunity to build a good relationship with your dog.<br>
					• If you don’t have an older dog in the home, try to find friends or family with a friendly, calm dog and let them have time together to play and interact on a regular basis. All puppies and dogs need frequent, safe interaction with other dogs to stay happy and healthy and learn normal dog behaviour.<br>
					• To housetrain quickly, you will need to take your puppy outside hourly. Puppies have very weak bladder control and will need to relieve themselves regularly throughout the day.<br>
					
		        </div>
		        <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
		        	• Place a suitable collar on your puppy and allow him time to get used to it. Remember to fasten it up tight enough, so that he cannot pull it over his head, but remember to make adjustments as he grows.<br>
		        	<h4>Healthcare for your puppy</h4>
					• Register your puppy with a local vet and have him checked over as soon as possible.<br>
					• Routine healthcare is very important and should begin when your puppy is young and be maintained throughout his lifetime.<br>
					• Make enquiries regarding pet insurance. Veterinary treatment can be expensive, particularly when you least expect it.<br>
					• If your puppy is not vaccinated ask your vet's advice as to the best age for the puppy to start the course.<br>
					• It is also important to maintain a strict worming and flea treatment regime, particularly during the puppy's first year.<br>
					• It is important for you to accustom your puppy to being examined regularly. Gently and regularly check his entire body including his ears, mouth, eyes, and paws.<br>
					• Only bath your puppy if necessary. This should be done with warm water and a mild shampoo.<br>
					• By eight weeks of age, your puppy will have a complete set of temporary teeth. Between the ages of three and six months the puppy will shed its baby teeth to allow for the adult teeth to come through. Dental care should start as soon as possible.

			        <h4>Pumba</h4>
					Congratulations to Pumba on a new page in life!It would be difficult to find a home for such a special baby, but fate has done its job 😢Fate has done its job!
					In a good way, our sweety!<br>
					<br><img class="img-fluid" src="img/storys/1.jpg"><br><br>
			        <h4>Jessica</h4>
					Jessica is looking for a responsible family!🐶
					Jessica is 1 year old. Sterilized, vaccinated.
					By nature, there are moments that need to be solved (hyperactive, does not know commands, aggresses on other animals).👹👼🏻
					It is given according to the contract, after acquaintance, with the condition of tracking the fate of the dog.<br>
					<br><img class="img-fluid" src="img/storys/2.jpg"><br><br>
					<h4>Shura</h4>
					Since 2018, Shura has been waiting. No one wanted dogs with pronounced aggression, everyone was afraid of her character and no one understood how cool she was! For the shelter, Shura became a personal disaster, she reacted very aggressively to dogs.🤼‍♀🐶
					Finally, our girl has found her family!
					HAVE A GOOD TRIP, BABY! Behave yourself there, your parents are wonderful! Everything will work out!😁💗<br>

					<h4>Sultan</h4>
					Sultan, who came to the shelter in August last year, found a family 🐾 Now our boy will run and jump as much as he needs, and not huddle in an aviary ❤
					He ended up in a shelter with a fractured paw and spine. And so, after a year and a half, we see him off on a good journey 😢 ✨
					Good luck to you, our baby. Don't be sad in your new home, you'll get used to it quickly.☺<br>
					<br><img class="img-fluid" src="img/storys/4.jpg"><br><br>
			        <h4>Rango</h4>
					Rango is a tireless wanderer who, found himself in a shelter. He appeared out of nowhere in one of the courtyards of Moscow, all in scars, thin, sometimes bald and without front teeth. Thanks to the attention of caring people, the guy nevertheless came in a shelter, where he started eat and covered himself with shiny new hair. 😢Amazingly, despite a difficult past, Rango has not lost trust in humans. He, like a huge kitten, snuggles up to the feet of a person and waits, strokes and caresses Rango by an incredibly kind and outgoing boy. He happily greets all the guests in the aviary with his welcoming dance and wags his tail so that it seems about to take off. Outwardly, he looks older than his years, but in fact he is quite a young 4-year-old dog. He still has a whole life ahead, which would be so great to spend at home in warmth and love.🥰<br>
					<br><img class="img-fluid" src="img/storys/5.jpg"><br><br>
					<h4>Leia</h4>
					Leia could have lived a very interesting life full of adventure! She could be a faithful companion on walks, on trips, or just a warm fluffy lump in whose arms you can hide in moments of sadness Leia could, but she lives so short that you don't have time to look back, as they put you behind bars again. 😥😥😥<br>
					She could lie back and refused to part with the person, and now, it seems, she has almost resigned herself to her fate! shelter. At the shelter for a walk But we still believe that such a wonderful girl must find her home! Leia is not against the company of other dogs, but she is one of those who really need a person. Her heart belongs to a man Please look into these eyes. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗❤❤❤<br>

					Three weeks have passed since Stout became home. Stout came to the orphanage relatively recently and not so long there and lived there, probably he was lucky or maybe fate ... But probably this story is for greetings from home, someday he will be obligatory) 🥲
					Stout's owner came to the orphanage, it seems a little more than a month. They learned to interact, communicate, walk and not only Vika got used to the fact that they would soon be sent to a new life, Stout was getting used to it too, in the end it seems to me that he understood. 🥰🥰🥰
					<br><img class="img-fluid" src="img/storys/7.jpg"><br>
					Upon arriving home, the stout was taken to a groomer, where he was tidied up, cut off all the old mats, washed off all the memories of the shelter and sent him to a new happy life. Not everything is super smooth, since Stout did not want to immediately perceive that besides him, a cat still lives in the house), but a little patience (Vika will probably say that there is a lot of patience), time and the guys will definitely get it right. Let's wish Vick and Stout, and now his name is Sherri, happy long years, and of course, that everyone gets used to a new life and live a close-knit family.😁<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Reyna</h4>
					Imagine, our gentle, affectionate girl, a red bun, which we all remember well, has been home-made and truly happy for a year now!
					How does a dog change when it finds a home! It's incredible In the photo, you can see that Reyna has lost those extra pounds and is gradually gaining athletic form together with her owner.😍😍😍<br>
			        <h4>Thin</h4>
					Thin, neat and very gentle Marlena came to the shelter as a puppy, she has not yet had time to understand all the rules of life and is completely unaware of where she is, what needs to be done. Now she is the personification of childish fragility, naivety and gullibility, because there was no cruelty in her life, and we believe that there never will be.🙏
					This baby loves the attention of people, the company of other dogs, and with pleasure invites everyone to play or lie in the grass. You will never be bored with this cute girl.😍😍😍<br>
